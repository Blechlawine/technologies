| Pros                                    | Cons                                       |
| --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Beautiful UI in my opinion              | Not as widely used as, for example, GitLab |

| Everything you expect from a git server |                                            |
| CI/CD                                   |                                            |
| Open-source                             |                                            |
