## Onedev

[Repository](https://code.onedev.io/onedev/server)

A Self-hosted Git Server with Kanban and CI/CD

| Pros                                    | Cons                                       |
| --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Beautiful UI in my opinion              | Not as widely used as, for example, GitLab |
| Dark mode                               |                                            |
| Everything you expect from a git server |                                            |
| CI/CD                                   |                                            |
| Open-source                             |                                            |
