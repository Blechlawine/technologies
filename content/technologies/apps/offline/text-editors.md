## VS-code / VS-codium

[Website (VS-code)](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

[Website (VS-codium)](https://vscodium.com/)

Probably the most powerful code editor / IDE. VS-code is open-source and made and maintained by Microsoft, but VS-codium is a clone without all the microsoft "features".

| Pros                                                  | Cons                                      |
| ----------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Can do anything source-code editing related           | VS-code is maintained by Microsoft        |
| A lot of extensions available                         | Built with electron -> very memory hungry |
| Decently fast                                         | Slower than other editors                 |
| Real-time collaboration support, through an extension | Not perfect for some use-cases            |
| Popular                                               |                                           |
| Git-integration                                       |                                           |

A newer Vim.

| Pros                              | Cons                                                                                                            |

## Helix

[Website (https://helix-editor.com/)](https://helix-editor.com/)

A newer newer Vim

| Pros                                                                        | Cons                                                      |

## Atom (dead) / Pulsar (pre-release)

[Github (Pulsar)](https://github.com/pulsar-edit/pulsar)

Github stopped developing Atom, but the community revived it with the Pulsar editor. I have only used Atom before, but I guess Pulsar shouldn't be too different.

| Pros                                         | Cons                                      |
| -------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| A lot of extensions and themes               | Built with Electron -> very memory hungry |
| Hackable with JavaScript and CSS             |                                           |
| Real-time collaboration through an extension |                                           |
| Git-integration                              |                                           |
