## VS-code / VS-codium

[Website (VS-code)](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

[Website (VS-codium)](https://vscodium.com/)

Probably the most powerful code editor / IDE. VS-code is open-source and made and maintained by Microsoft, but VS-codium is a clone without all the microsoft "features".

### Pros

-   Can do anything source-code editing related
-   A lot of extensions available
-   Decently fast
-   Real-time collaboration support, through an extension
-   Popular
-   Built with electron -> very memory hungry
-   Git-integration

### Cons

-   VS-code is maintained by Microsoft
-   Slower than other editors
-   Not perfect for some use-cases

A newer Vim.

### Pros

## Helix

[Website (https://helix-editor.com/)](https://helix-editor.com/)

A newer newer Vim

| Pros                                                                        | Cons                                                      |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| Sensible defaults                                                           | No plugins                                                |
| Plugins not needed, because most important things are integrated by default | Not as popular as Vim/Neovim -> not many tools support it |
| Minimal, but powerful configuration files                                   |                                                           |

## Atom (dead) / Pulsar (pre-release)

[Github (Pulsar)](https://github.com/pulsar-edit/pulsar)

Github stopped developing Atom, but the community revived it with the Pulsar editor. I have only used Atom before, but I guess Pulsar shouldn't be too different.

| Pros                                         | Cons                                      |
| -------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| A lot of extensions and themes               | Built with Electron -> very memory hungry |
| Hackable with JavaScript and CSS             |                                           |
| Real-time collaboration through an extension |                                           |
| Git-integration                              |                                           |
