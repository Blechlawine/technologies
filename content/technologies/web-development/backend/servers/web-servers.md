## Caddy

[Website (https://caddyserver.com/)](https://caddyserver.com/)

| Pros                                                        | Cons                                  |
| ----------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Fast                                                        | Not as popular as, for example, nginx |
| Really easy to configure                                    |                                       |
| Configurable via an API (optional)                          |                                       |
| Automatic SSL                                               |                                       |
| Can probably do everything you would want from a web-server |                                       |

## Nginx

| ------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| Very popular                                      | Configuration is pretty painful in comparison to Caddy |
| Fast                                              | No real advantages for most use-cases over Caddy       |
| Can do everything you would want from a webserver |                                                        |
