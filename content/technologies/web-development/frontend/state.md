## Vue

Due to great built-in state-management you don't need a state-management library. But if you do need one, here's the best one:

| Pros | Cons                                                                                                                                 |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      | Needs a literal truck load of boilerplate                                                                                            |
|      | Can apparently even be used with other frontend frameworks, but thos other frontend frameworks have better state-management built in |
