## Vue

Due to great built-in state-management you don't need a state-management library. But if you do need one, here's the best one:

### Pinia

[Website (https://pinia.vuejs.org/)](https://pinia.vuejs.org/)

In my opinion the best state-management library ever

---

## Svelte

Due to great built-in state-management you don't need a state-management library.

---

## Solid

Due to great built-in state-management you don't need a state-management library.

## React

### Zustand

[Github](https://github.com/pmndrs/zustand)

#### Pros

-   Great for more complex state, or state that you want to change from outside your components
-   small bundle size
-   almost no boilerplate

### Jotai

[Github](https://github.com/pmndrs/jotai)

#### Pros

-   great if you just want to share some simple state between components
-   small bundle size
-   no boilerplate

### Redux

[Website (https://redux.js.org/)](https://redux.js.org/)

#### Cons

-   Needs a literal truck load of boilerplate
-   Can apparently be even used with other frontend frameworks, but those other frontend frameworks have better state-management built in
