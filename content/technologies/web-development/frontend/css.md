# Styling and CSS

---

## Tailwindcss

[Website](https://tailwindcss.com/)

CSS Utility classes

### Pros

-   Popular
-   Extensions for most editors
-   very flexible
-   In Combination with DaisyUI great UI Building blocks

### Cons

-   you get very long class definitions in your HTML

---

## Unocss

[Github](https://github.com/unocss/unocss)

An atomic CSS engine. Will apparently power Windicss 4.

### Pros

-   very flexible
-   Presets for high compatibility with Tailwindcss or windicss
-   Preset for icons ðŸ¤¯
-   Presets for many more ui frameworks, like Bootstrap (obviously only providing the styling)
-   Attributify mode helps against long class definitions in HTML
-   VS-code extension

### Cons

-   still in experimental, although some people use it in production already (mainly the creator)

---

## Windicss

[Website](https://windicss.org/)

CSS Utility classes, just like tailwindcss

### Pros

-   more flexible than tailwindcss, because it always tries to guess the size
    for example in tailwind this might not exist: p-100
    In Windicss it will probably work
-   High compatibility with Tailwindcss
-   Attributify mode helps against long class definitions in HTML
-   VS-code extension
