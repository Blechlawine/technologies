# Frameworks

Yes some of these are technically libraries, not frameworks, but everyone calls them frameworks, so here they are.

---

## Vue

[Website](https://vuejs.org/)

Its pronounced /vjuÀê/, like view. This is my personal favorite frontend framework and I tried most of the ones on this list.

### Pros

-   Vite is the recommended way of creating a Vue app
-   Popular
-   Great typescript support
-   Documentation is great
-   Single-file-components
-   requires less code for the same functionality than most other frameworks
-   built-in app state-management

### Cons

-   ü§∑

## Svelte

[Website](https://svelte.dev/)

### Pros

-   Great syntax
-   requires less code for the same functionality than most other frameworks
-   Good typescript support
-   built-in app state-management

### Cons

-   Svelte's syntax can sometimes be very weird

---

## Solid

[Website](https://www.solidjs.com/)

### Pros

-   Fast as fuck (aparently, I wasnt able to tell a difference to other frameworks)
-   Smol bundle
-   Decent Typescript support
-   built-in app state-management

### Cons

-   JSX
-   Typescript support is kinda bad, but that is a problem with JSX in general

---

## Preact

[Website](https://preactjs.com/)

### Pros

-   Same syntax as React, so if you know React, you can work with this
-   Tries to achieve 100% compatibility with React
-   Built-in app state-management
-   Relatively small bundle size (compared to React)

### Cons

-   JSX
-   Same syntax as React (as in not as good as Svelte or especially Vue)
-   Docs are sometimes not totally right, if you want to use typescript

## React

[Website](https://reactjs.org/)

### Pros

-   Popular
-   Has typescript support

### Cons

-   JSX
-   requires a third-party library for literally everything
-   Typescript support is kinda bad, which is a problem with JSX in general
-   Performance is terrible compared to all other options on this list, even worse than Webassembly ([Framework Performance Comparison](https://javascript.plainenglish.io/javascript-frameworks-performance-comparison-2020-cd881ac21fce))
-   I heard its slow at SSR
