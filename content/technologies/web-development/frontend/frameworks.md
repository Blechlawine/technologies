# Frameworks

Yes some of these are technically libraries, not frameworks, but everyone calls them frameworks, so here they are.

## Vue

[Website (https://vuejs.org/)](https://vuejs.org/)

Its pronounced /vjuÀê/, like view. This is my personal favorite frontend framework and I tried most of the ones on this list.

| Pros                                                                     | Cons |

| Built-in app state management                                            |                                        |

| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Really fast (aparently, I wasn'y able to tell a difference to other frameworks) | JSX                                                                                       |

| Decent Typescript support                                                       |                                                                                           |

| ------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Same syntax as React, so if you know React, you can work with this | JSX                                                                             |
| Tries to achieve 100% compatibility with React                     | Same syntax as React (as in not as good as Svelte or especially Vue)            |
| Built-in app state-management                                      | Docs are sometimes not completely right, if you want to use Typescript          |
| Relatively small bundle size                                       | Two State-management solutions make it unintuitive as to how they work together |

|                        | Typescript support in the template is kinda bad, which is a problem with JSX in general |
|                        | Performance is terrible compared to all other options on this list                      |
|                        | I heard it's supposed to be slow at SSR                                                 |
